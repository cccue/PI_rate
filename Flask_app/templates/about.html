<strong> <font color="black"> Mea culpa: </font> Hi, my name is Carlos 
and Pi-rate is my small contribution
to the world of rums. As a Cuban rum lover this app was long overdue. 
I am the soul solely responsible for the ideas and concepts behind the 
development of this app. Proper acknowledgments have been stated (I hope) 
in several
sections when using third party tools as a way to enhance the site
functionality. The analysis provided here would not have been possible 
without <a href="https://www.rumratings.com">RumRatings</a> and
the great reviews contributed by its users.
